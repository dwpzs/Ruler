# Simple Phone Ruler

This project turns your phone screen into a basic **visual ruler**.  
There is **no calibration** — instead, it renders a ruler based on the screen width as a reference display.

## What this project does
- Displays a basic horizontal ruler across the phone screen
- Shows cm markings visually
- No calibration or measurement drawing features
- Intended only for rough visual measurement or for drawing straight lines on top of the phone

## Files included
- `index.html`
- `styles.css`
- `app.js`
- `README.md`

## How to run
Simply open `index.html` in any browser or upload it to Replit to host it.

## Notes
This ruler is not guaranteed to be physically accurate (since all screens have different pixel density), but can be used for rough estimation.
